                        Should we practice poses before the wedding?

                        Yes! Practice during engagement shoots or at home. Familiarity with poses helps you feel

                        Walking poses, silhouettes, and natural interaction poses work beautifully outdoors. Use natural
                        elements like trees, water, and architecture for framing.
